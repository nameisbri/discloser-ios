Name: Discloser
Subtitle: STI Status, Shared Safely

Description:
Share proof, not your life story. Discloser lets you share your STI test results without exposing your identity.

Generate time-limited, view-limited links that expire automatically. Your partner sees your status — not your name, date of birth, or health card number.

FEATURES:
- Upload test results with AI-powered extraction
- Share links that vanish after you set them to expire
- Set view limits — share once, twice, or as many times as you choose
- QR codes for quick, in-person sharing
- Track your testing history in one place
- Get personalized reminders based on your risk level
- Share your aggregated STI status or individual results
- Manage known conditions separately from routine tests
- Privacy-first design with row-level security

WHY DISCLOSER:
Being responsible shouldn't cost you your privacy. Lab results contain personal information — your full name, date of birth, health card number — that stays on someone's phone forever once they take a screenshot.

With Discloser, you share the verification, not the identity. You control how long the link lives, how many times it can be viewed, and whether your name appears at all.

PRIVACY:
- Your data stays private with row-level security
- Links auto-expire — you control how long they last
- No data selling or tracking
- Choose to share anonymously, with an alias, or your first name

Download Discloser and share your status. Keep your name.
